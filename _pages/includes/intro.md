#  About me

I am currently a first-year Master student at Tsinghua University as a member of [IC-LAB](https://thusigsiclab.github.io/thu.github.io/), advised by Prof.[Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

Previously, I received my B.Eng. Degree from College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University in 2023.

I am now working on **Diffusion-based Content Generation** research, such as 3D object, video and human motion generation. If you would like to have an academic discussion or cooperation, please feel free to email me at [linyk23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:linyk23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).
